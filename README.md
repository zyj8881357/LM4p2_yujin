# LM4p2_yujin
Yujin's repository for GFDL land model development:
There are two branches for my major land model developments in this LM4p2_yujin repository.

The branch named 'topographic_disaggregation' is for the development of topographic disaggregation for hydro-climatic variables. 
I also tagged the starting point from which I started to develope as 'disagg_start'.

The branch named 'irrigation_reservoir' is for the development of irrigation and reservoirs in the land model.
I also tagged the starting point as 'irri_rsv_start'.

There are also some developments in atmospheric model and coupler code. I did not push them here as they are not in the land component. 
If you are interested about it or have any questions about the code, please contact me via Email yujinz@princeton.edu.

Thank you!
